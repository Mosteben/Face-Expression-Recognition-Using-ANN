# Face Expression Recognition Using ANN

Face expression recognition (FER) is a task in computer vision where the goal is to identify human emotions based on facial expressions. This project implements a face expression recognition system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is **FER2013**, which contains 35,887 grayscale images of size 48x48 pixels, categorized into seven emotions:
- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happiness
- Neutral
- Sadness
- Surprise

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is essential for improving the performance of the ANN model. This typically involves:

- **Resizing Images**: Ensuring all images are of the same size (e.g., 48x48 pixels).
- **Normalization**: Scaling pixel values to a range of [0, 1] to help the ANN learn more efficiently.
- **Data Augmentation**: Generating variations of the training images (rotations, flips, etc.) to increase the dataset size and improve model generalization.

## Building the ANN Model

A typical ANN model for face expression recognition consists of several layers:

- **Input Layer**: The input layer takes the preprocessed images. Each pixel in the image corresponds to a neuron in this layer.
  
- **Hidden Layers**: These layers are where the learning occurs. Common architectures include:
  - **Fully Connected Layers**: Each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.
  - **Convolutional Layers (CNN)**: Often used in image processing, CNNs apply convolutional filters to extract features from the images.

- **Output Layer**: The output layer consists of neurons corresponding to each emotion category. The activation function (usually Softmax) is applied to output a probability distribution over the emotions.

## Model Training

Training the ANN involves the following steps:

- **Loss Function**: The model uses a loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) to evaluate the difference between predicted and actual labels during training.
  
- **Backpropagation**: The model updates its weights using backpropagation to minimize the loss function. Optimizers like Adam or SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) can be used.

- **Epochs and Batch Size**: The training process is repeated for several epochs, with the dataset divided into batches.

## Model Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a validation or test dataset.

- **Confusion Matrix**: This helps visualize the performance of the model in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each emotion.

## Deployment

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for real-time face expression recognition. This typically involves:

- **Integration with a Camera**: Using OpenCV or similar libraries to capture video streams and detect faces.
  
- **Real-time Prediction**: The trained model can predict emotions on the detected faces and display the results in real time.

## Example Code Structure

A typical GitHub repository for a face expression recognition system might include:

- **Preprocessing Scripts**: Code for data preprocessing.
- **Model Definition**: Scripts to define the ANN model architecture (using TensorFlow/Keras).
- **Training Scripts**: Code to train the model and save the trained weights.
- **Evaluation Scripts**: Code to evaluate the model and visualize results.
- **Deployment Scripts**: Code to capture video from a camera and perform real-time predictions.

## Conclusion

Face expression recognition using ANN is a powerful application of machine learning, allowing computers to understand human emotions. With advancements in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the accuracy and efficiency of such systems have significantly improved.
